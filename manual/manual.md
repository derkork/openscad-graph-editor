# OpenSCAD Graph Editor Manual

_This manual is currently being written._

## Introduction
OpenSCAD is a 3D CAD program that can be used to create 3D models through scripting. The OpenSCAD Graph Editor is a graphical user interface for OpenSCAD that allows you to create 3D models by connecting nodes in a graph. The editor will automatically generate OpenSCAD code for you.

## Installation & Setup

You can download the latest release of the OpenSCAD Graph Editor from [GitHub](https://github.com/derkork/openscad-graph-editor/releases) extract it to a convenient location and run the program. No installation procedure is required. 

If you want to have a live preview while you are editing, you will also need to download and install [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/downloads.html). Then arrange the windows of OpenSCAD Graph Editor and OpenSCAD so that they are next to each other (or place them on different monitors if you happen to have a multi-monitor setup). It is recommended that you hide the editor in the OpenSCAD window (_Window_ -> _Hide Editor_).
